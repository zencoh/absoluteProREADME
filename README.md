## Description
This project prompts the user with questions about their project to then generate a README.md file for the user. I was motivated to create this project because it will help me automate part of my future projects by having a template that will ensure that my README.md files are all uniform across different projects. This project solves the problem of having a README.md file that doesn't meet grading requirements, now all my future README.md files should always meet the criteria because they all follow the same format. My project stands out compared to others because I utilized multiple switch loops which was difficult when I first learned about them but is now another tool in my developer tool belt.

## Installation
Once you answer the prompts and the README.md file is created then you simply need to move it into your current project. You can use your terminal or file explorer to acheive this.

## Usage
Usage is simple for this project. In the terminal just 'cd' into the absoluteProREADME directory then type 'node index.js' to start the prompts.

## Contributing
Thank you for investing your time in reading through my code and README. Since I am creating this application for a coding bootcamp I am not taking contributions at this time.

## Tests
If there is a README.md file created then Pass. If there is not a README.md file created then Fail.
